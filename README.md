# Sustainable Finance and Energy Management Platform

## About the Project

### Inspiration
The inspiration for our project came from the urgent need to address climate change and promote sustainability. We wanted to create a platform that empowers individuals to make eco-friendly financial decisions, helping them reduce their carbon footprint while managing their finances effectively.

### What it does
The Sustainable Finance and Energy Management Platform allows users to:
- Track their energy consumption and receive tips on reducing usage.
- Analyze their spending patterns and categorize them into eco-friendly and non-eco-friendly.
- Invest in eco-friendly companies and view real-time stock charts.
- Earn rewards for sustainable actions, such as purchasing organic products.

### How we built it
We built the platform using:
- **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** for the frontend to create a responsive and interactive user interface.
- **Chart.js** for data visualization to display energy usage and spending analysis.
- **TradingView Widget** for real-time stock charts of eco-friendly companies.
- **Tesseract.js** for optical character recognition (OCR) to analyze receipts for organic products.
- **LocalStorage** for managing user sessions and storing data locally.

### Challenges we ran into
One of the major challenges was integrating the TradingView widget and ensuring it worked seamlessly with our platform. Additionally, implementing the OCR functionality to accurately analyze receipts and distinguish organic products was complex. We also faced difficulties in ensuring the platform remained user-friendly and visually appealing.

### Accomplishments that we're proud of
We are proud of successfully integrating multiple technologies to create a comprehensive platform that addresses various aspects of sustainable living. The OCR functionality for analyzing receipts and the real-time stock charts are significant achievements. Additionally, the seamless user experience and responsive design are highlights of our project.

### What we learned
Throughout this project, we learned how to effectively integrate different technologies and tools to build a cohesive platform. We gained insights into data visualization, real-time data integration, and the importance of user experience design. We also enhanced our problem-solving skills by overcoming various technical challenges.

### What's next for Sustainable Finance and Energy Management Platform
In the future, we plan to:
- Expand the investment options to include more eco-friendly companies and funds.
- Integrate more advanced machine learning algorithms to enhance the OCR functionality.
- Develop mobile applications to make the platform more accessible.
